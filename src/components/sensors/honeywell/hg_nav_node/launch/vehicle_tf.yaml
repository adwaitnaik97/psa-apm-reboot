#Transformations from HGuide frame

# Transformations defined as array
# missing 'pos' or 'rpy' are replaced by [0,0,0]
# Transformations are applied in ROS (ENU) frame
Transformations:
  - frameName: velodyne
    pos: [1,0,0.1] # [m]
    rpy: [0,0,3] # [deg]
  - frameName: second
    pos: [1,1,0.1] # [m]
    rpy: [0,90,180] # [deg]
  - frameName: third
    pos: [-1,0,0.1] # [m]
    rpy: [0,0,90] # [deg]
